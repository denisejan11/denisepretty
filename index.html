        <h2>Autobiography</h2>
        <p>Macalino, born on the 16th of May 2003, is the second child and eldest daughter of Rossana Macalino and Alfredo Hermida Macalino Jr. Macalino family had two other children. Carl Joshua Macalino, born on the 22nd of September 2001, is the first-born and only son of the family. The youngest and second daughter â€” Eihl Jester Macalino, was born on the 21st of August 2005. Denise, from a young age, she felt a sense of responsibility that many of her peers didn't seem to understand. As the oldest daughter in a tight-knit family, she quickly became aware of the expectations placed on her. Balancing schoolwork, household chores, and taking care of her younger siblings was a constant challenge. There were times when she felt torn between my own academic ambitions and her desire to support my family. The pressure often felt overwhelming, and she frequently questioned how she could juggle all the responsibilities. However, through trial and error, she learned that life isn't about doing everything at once it's about finding balance and knowing when to ask for help. In the beginning, managing all of my duties felt like a struggle. But as she navigated through it, she began to recognize the importance of time management. She developed a routine that allowed me to stay on top of my studies while still fulfilling her role at home. It wasn't always easy, and there were days when everything seemed to go wrong, but over time, she found a rhythm that worked for her. She also realized that setting boundaries was key not just for my academic success, but for my mental and emotional well-being. She understood that being the oldest didn't mean she had to do everything alone. It meant leading by example, showing her siblings the importance of responsibility, while also teaching them that it's okay to ask for help when needed. This shift in mindset changed the way she approached both her studies and her personal life. She learned that she didn't have to sacrifice my own dreams for the sake of my family's needs. She found ways to continue pursuing my passion's wether  that meant staying up late to finish an assignment or carving out small moments for personal growths without neglecting her responsibilities at home. This balance became the foundation of who she is. She realized that you can take care of others and still prioritize your own goals. The two do not have to conflict with one another. A major turning point in my life came when she moved to the city for college. Leaving the comfort of her hometown, her friends, and everything familiar was a huge leap. In the beginning, the loneliness and uncertainty were almost overwhelming. she questioned whether she'd made the right decision, and she struggled to adjust to her new environment. But over time, she learned to navigate the challenges on her own whether it was making new friends, managing her time, or simply finding her way around an unfamiliar city. Slowly, she discovered a new level of independence she hadn't known she was capable of. This experience taught her the power of embracing change, even when it feels uncomfortable. She came to understand that growth often happens outside of your comfort zone, and that stepping into the unknown is the key to discovering your true potential. It wasn't an easy transition, but it pushed her in ways she hadn't anticipated. The challenges she faced helped her build the confidence to tackle future obstacles with a stronger sense of purpose. Moving away from home didn't just shape her academic future, it gave her the courage to face life's uncertainties head-on. Through this journey, she learned that personal growth is about being willing to embrace discomfort and rise to meet new challenges. And in the end, the rewards of that discomfort are always worth it.</p>

        <h2>Plagiarism</h2>
        <p>Plagiarism is the unethical and often illegal act of taking someone else's intellectual property, including written content, ideas, creative works such as art, music, or designs, or even their unique expressions of thought, and using it without proper acknowledgment, credit, or authorization, thereby misrepresenting it as one's original work, which can occur in various forms such as directly copying text, paraphrasing without citation, repurposing one's own previous work without disclosure (self-plagiarism), or reproducing creative materials without permission, all of which can lead to significant academic, professional, or legal consequences if not carefully avoided through appropriate attribution and adherence to intellectual property rights.</p>

              <h4></h4>
              <p><em>Plagiarism carries significant consequences across various aspects of life, including academics, professional careers, and legal matters. In an academic setting, it can result in severe penalties such as failing grades on assignments or courses, suspension, or even expulsion from an institution. A record of academic dishonesty can tarnish a student's reputation and harm future educational or career prospects. In professional environments, plagiarism can lead to job termination, loss of credibility, and damaged relationships with colleagues and clients. Employers often view plagiarism as a breach of ethics and trust, making it difficult for the individual to secure future opportunities.

                Moreover, plagiarism can have legal consequences, especially if it involves violating copyright laws. This may result in fines, lawsuits, or other legal actions. Beyond these tangible outcomes, plagiarism also carries the intangible cost of damaging oneâ€™s integrity and personal reputation. It signals a lack of originality and effort, which can have a lasting impact on how others perceive the individual. In all contexts, plagiarism undermines trust and credibility, making it essential to prioritize originality and proper citation to avoid these far-reaching consequences.</em></p>

            <h3 class="resume-title">How to Avoid Plagiarism</h3>
            <div class="resume-item">
              <h4></h4>
              <h5></h5>
              <p><em>To avoid plagiarism, it's important to first understand what constitutes it, including direct copying, paraphrasing without credit, and improper citation. Always give proper credit to the original author by citing your sources in the appropriate format (e.g., APA, MLA, Chicago). When paraphrasing, make sure to restate ideas in your own words while maintaining the original meaning, and remember to cite the source. If you're using a direct quote, place it in quotation marks and provide a citation. Taking clear and organized notes during research helps keep track of sources, ensuring proper attribution later. Additionally, using plagiarism detection tools like Turnitin or Grammarly can help you ensure your work is original. Focusing on developing your own ideas and seeking guidance when in doubt about citations are also crucial steps. By following these practices, you can maintain academic integrity and avoid plagiarism.</em></p>

              <ul>
                <p></p>There are several types of plagiarism, each involving different forms of dishonesty. Direct plagiarism occurs when someone copies another person's work or ideas word-for-word without giving credit. Self-plagiarism happens when an individual reuses their own previous work or parts of it without proper citation, treating it as new content. Mosaic plagiarism, also known as patchwriting, involves piecing together phrases or ideas from various sources without proper citation, often altering a few words while retaining the original structure. Accidental plagiarism can occur when a person unintentionally fails to cite sources or misquotes them due to lack of understanding or oversight. Paraphrasing plagiarism occurs when someone rewords another person's ideas without proper citation, even if the wording has been altered. Each of these types of plagiarism violates the principles of academic integrity and intellectual honesty, and they can lead to severe consequences.</li>

          A virus is a specific type of malicious software, or malware, designed to spread from one computer to another by attaching itself to legitimate files or programs. When these infected files are executed, the virus activates, potentially causing harm such as corrupting data, slowing down system performance, or even crashing the system entirely. Viruses typically require user interaction, like opening an infected file or running a program, to spread and cause damage.</p>
      
          <p>Malware, on the other hand, is a broader term that encompasses all types of malicious software created with the intent to harm, exploit, or gain unauthorized access to computers, networks, or data. This includes viruses but also covers other forms of threats such as worms (which self-replicate and spread without user interaction), trojans (malicious programs disguised as legitimate software), ransomware (which locks users out of their data until a ransom is paid), spyware (which secretly gathers information about users), and adware (which bombards users with unwanted advertisements). Malware can infiltrate systems through various means, such as malicious downloads, phishing emails, or compromised websites.</p>
      
          <p>To combat these threats, antivirus software plays a crucial role. Antivirus programs are designed to detect, prevent, and remove viruses and other forms of malware. They achieve this by scanning files, monitoring system behavior, and comparing code against a database of known threats. Modern antivirus solutions often include features like real-time protection, heuristic analysis to detect new or unknown threats, and tools to fix damage caused by infections. By regularly updating antivirus software and practicing safe online habits, users can significantly reduce the risk of falling victim to viruses and other malicious attacks.</p>
